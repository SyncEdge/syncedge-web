# Cold Email Drafts for Dental Clinics

## 1. Smile & Co. Dental Clinic

**To:** smileandco1@gmail.com
**Subject:** Online booking system for Smile & Co.?

---

Dear Dr. Thanapol,

I came across Smile & Co. Dental Clinic and loved the "feel like home" concept you've created at your Phayathai location.

Many dental clinics I've spoken with face similar challenges:

- Patients booking via LINE or phone calls (hard to manage during busy hours)
- No-shows because patients forget their appointments
- Staff spending time on appointment confirmations instead of patient care

I build **online booking systems** for dental clinics — patients can book appointments 24/7, receive automatic reminders, and you get a dashboard showing your schedule at a glance.

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks delivery. You own everything.**

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call this week?

## 2. Edelweiss Dental House

**To:** contact@edelweissdentalhouse.com
**Subject:** Patient management system for Edelweiss Dental House?

---

Dear Asst. Prof. Dr. Atikom,

I found Edelweiss Dental House while researching dental clinics specializing in implants and Invisalign in Bangkok.

For clinics offering complex treatments like implants, I imagine tracking patient progress across multiple visits can be time-consuming — especially when records are scattered across different systems.

I develop **patient management systems** for dental clinics:

- Online appointment booking with treatment-specific time slots
- Patient records with treatment history in one place
- Automatic appointment reminders (reduce no-shows)
- Secure portal for patients to view their treatment plans

**Fixed price, 6-8 week delivery, full code ownership.**

Would a brief call be possible to see if this could help your clinic?

## 3. Thantakit International Dental Center

**To:** contact@thantakit.com
**Subject:** Digital booking for Thantakit's 80 years of excellence?

---

Dear Dr. Thara,

Thantakit's history is impressive — 80 years of dental care, now in the third generation. That's a legacy of trust few clinics can match.

With two branches and a reputation built over decades, I imagine managing appointments and patient records across locations requires significant coordination.

I build **clinic management systems** for dental practices:

- Centralized booking across multiple branches
- Patient history accessible from any location
- Automatic appointment reminders to reduce no-shows
- Dashboard for daily schedules and patient flow

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks. No vendor lock-in — you own the code.**

Would you or someone on your team have 15 minutes this week for a quick call?

## 4. S Dental Clinic Bangkok

**To:** contact@sdentalclinicbangkok.com
**Subject:** Online booking for S Dental Clinic?

---

สวัสดีครับ/ค่ะ,

I came across S Dental Clinic in the heart of Sukhumvit — great location for busy professionals.

Many clinics in business districts face the same challenge: patients want to book outside office hours, but staff can only answer calls during the day.

I develop **online booking systems** for dental clinics:

- 24/7 appointment booking for patients
- Automatic SMS/LINE reminders
- Real-time schedule management
- Reduce phone calls and no-shows

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks delivery. Full ownership — no monthly fees.**

Would a short call make sense to explore if this could help?

## 5. iDentist Dental Clinic

**To:** identistclinic89@gmail.com
**Subject:** Booking system for iDentist's 3 branches?

---

สวัสดีครับ/ค่ะ,

I noticed iDentist has expanded to 3 branches across Bangkok — Kaset, Jangwattana, and Rangsit.

Managing appointments across multiple locations can be challenging — especially ensuring patients book at the right branch and the right dentist is available.

I build **multi-branch booking systems** for dental clinics:

- Patients select branch, treatment, and time slot online
- Centralized dashboard to see all appointments across locations
- Automatic reminders reduce no-shows
- Patient records accessible from any branch

**Fixed price, 6-8 week delivery, you own everything.**

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call to see if this could help your growing practice?

## 6. Dental Image Clinic

**To:** dentalimagemail@gmail.com
**Subject:** Patient management for Dental Image's 5 locations?

---

Dear Dr. Anon,

Dental Image Clinic's growth is impressive — 5 branches and over 30 dentists across Bangkok since 2009.

With that scale, I imagine coordinating appointments, tracking implant cases across visits, and managing patient records requires significant operational effort.

I develop **clinic management systems** for multi-location dental practices:

- Centralized booking across all 5 branches
- Patient treatment history visible from any location
- Implant case tracking from consultation to completion
- Automatic appointment reminders
- Dashboard for management to see overall performance

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks delivery. Full code ownership — no vendor lock-in.**

Would you or someone on your operations team have time for a brief call?

## 7. Bangkok Inter Dental

**To:** contact@bangkokinterdental.com
**Subject:** Patient portal for Bangkok Inter Dental?

---

Dear Dr. Sunisa,

I noticed Bangkok Inter Dental serves many international patients — which often means coordinating across time zones and handling inquiries via email before patients arrive in Thailand.

I build **patient portals** for dental clinics with international clientele:

- Online booking in multiple languages
- Pre-visit questionnaires and medical history forms
- Treatment plan sharing before patients travel
- Secure communication between patients and your team
- Post-treatment follow-up reminders

**Fixed price, 6-8 week delivery, you own the code.**

Would a quick call make sense to explore if this could benefit your international patients?
