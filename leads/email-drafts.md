Dear Khun Jasika,

I came across ACC Consulting and saw that you provide accounting and auditing services for businesses across Thailand.

Many accounting firms struggle with:

- Clients sending documents via LINE or email (hard to organize)
- Chasing clients for documents before tax deadlines
- Sharing financial reports securely

I build **client portals** for accounting firms — a secure system where clients can upload documents, track deadlines, and download reports. You get notified instantly when files arrive.

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks delivery. You own everything.**

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call this week?

## 2. Plusitive Accounting & Advisory

**To:** plusitiveacc@gmail.com
**Subject:** Document management for Plusitive?

---

สวัสดีครับ/ค่ะ,

I noticed Plusitive Accounting has over 30 years of experience serving clients in Bangkok.

I'm reaching out because many accounting firms I've spoken with face the same challenges:

- Documents scattered across LINE, email, and Google Drive
- Manual follow-ups before submission deadlines
- No secure way to share sensitive financial reports

I develop **client portals** specifically for accounting firms — one place for document uploads, deadline reminders, and secure file sharing.

**Fixed pricing, 6-8 week delivery, full code ownership.**

Would a brief call be possible to see if this could help your firm?

เรียน Dr. Chaiyutm,

I found Account Club Thailand while researching leading accounting firms in Bangkok.

With a large client base, I imagine managing document collection and client communication takes significant effort.

I build **client portal systems** for accounting firms that:

- Let clients upload documents to one secure place
- Send automatic deadline reminders
- Provide secure access to financial reports
- Reduce back-and-forth communication

**Fixed price, delivered in 6-8 weeks, you own the code.**

Would you or someone on your team have 15 minutes this week for a quick call?

## 4. PM Accounting

**To:** pm.audit.acc@gmail.com
**Subject:** Client document portal for PM Accounting?

---

สวัสดีครับ/ค่ะ,

I saw that PM Accounting's team includes professionals from Big 4 backgrounds — impressive!

One thing I hear from accounting firms is how much time gets lost chasing clients for documents and managing files across LINE, email, and cloud storage.

I develop **client portals** that solve this:

- Secure document upload for clients
- Automatic deadline notifications
- Dashboard to track what's received vs. pending
- Secure report sharing

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks. Full ownership — no monthly fees or lock-in.**

Would a short call make sense to explore if this could help?

สวัสดีครับ/ค่ะ,

I found Bangkok Accounting Office while researching accounting firms in Chatuchak area.

Many firms I've spoken with spend too much time on document collection — chasing clients via LINE, organizing files from email, sending deadline reminders manually.

I develop **client portals** that automate this:

- Clients upload documents to one secure place
- Automatic deadline reminders sent to clients
- You see exactly what's received and what's missing
- Share financial reports securely

**Fixed price. 6-8 weeks delivery. No vendor lock-in.**

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call?

**Fixed pricing, 6-8 week delivery, full code ownership.**

Would someone on your team have time for a brief call this week?
